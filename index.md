## Group Project - Natural Gas Market in Turkey 

This project explains some insights about **Natural Gas Market in Turkey** and all the processes that were completed in order to obtain the results.

* Our main goal is to express current values and changes in both datasets which include Gas Reference Prices and Total Trade Volumes for the years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.
* We visualized values of Gas Reference Price and Total Trade Volume of years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021 as well as their average and change depending on different time periods.
* We also analyzed some critical points that carry anomalies such as daily and monthly maximums and minimums.

The source data files are 2 XLS files which are obtained from EPIAS' **[Transparency Platform website.](https://seffaflik.epias.com.tr/transparency/)**
